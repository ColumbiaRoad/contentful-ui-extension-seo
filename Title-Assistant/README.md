*Title Assistant Contentful Field Extension

This extension enables a content editor inside contentful to immediately see how a given page title, url-slug, and meta description will render in a google search result. The field itself is made to render a character count that warns the editor when the full title goes over a set limit as well as appending a globaly set brand-name to the chosen title fields.
There is also a switch for manually removing the appending of the brand name and links to moz.com articles about SEO best practices.
